"""Local web app. The engine, live, over HTTP.

    python serve.py            then open http://localhost:8000

Unlike the published artifact, which replays generated data, this runs the real
`decide()` on whatever you type. Type something nobody scripted and watch the
engine handle it -- or fail to, which is more useful.

Standard library only. No framework, no build step, nothing to install: the
project's "runs bare" property is worth more than the convenience of FastAPI.

TWO ROLES ON ONE SCREEN, because that is the actual workflow. The patient types
free text and the nurse records observations, and they are not the same input:
what a patient says is narrative to be extracted with evidence, while what a
nurse sees is an observation recorded directly. The screen keeps them apart so
the provenance of every check stays visible.
