"""The audit trail, and clinician overrides.

Two things the Round 2 brief asks for directly:

    "Clinical accountability and liability mean any recommendation must remain
     reviewable and overridable by a licensed clinician, with a clear audit
     trail and compliance with health-data regulation."

    "Capture at least one clinician override and show what the system logs."

JURISDICTION: UK. UK GDPR plus the Data Protection Act 2018, health data as
special category under Article 9. Lawful basis for the care record is Article
6(1)(e) public task with Article 9(2)(h) health and social care -- NOT consent,
which is the common mistake: a patient cannot meaningfully refuse the basis on
which they are being treated, so consent is the wrong instrument here. Consent
is recorded separately, and only for things that genuinely are optional, like
recording audio.

That choice of jurisdiction determines what an override has to record. It is not
enough to log "a nurse changed it". The record needs an identifiable clinician, a
timestamp, what was recommended, what it was changed to, why, and the state of
the system at that moment -- otherwise nobody reviewing an incident can tell
whether the tool misled the clinician or the clinician overruled a correct call.

TAMPER EVIDENCE. Each event carries the hash of the one before it, so altering
history after the fact breaks the chain and `verify()` says so. That is not the
same as tamper-PROOF -- anyone who can rewrite the whole ledger can recompute
every digest. It makes silent edits detectable, which is what an audit trail is
actually for.

IMMUTABILITY. The CTAS manual is explicit:

    "The triage nurse documents the reassessment findings and any changes in the
     patient's acuity score, however, THE INITIAL TRIAGE SCORE IS NEVER CHANGED."

So nothing here mutates. Re-scoring appends, overriding appends, and the first
decision stays legible forever.
